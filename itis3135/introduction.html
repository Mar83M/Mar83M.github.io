                    <li>CIS110 - Introduction to Computers - we have a lot of these sections, so i teach it a lot.</li>

            <!-- <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.</li> -->
